          <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600">A point of sale, or point of purchase, is where you ring up customers. When customers check out online, walk up to your checkout counter, or pick out an item from your stand or booth, theyâ€™re at the point of sale. 

Your point-of-sale system is the hardware and software that enable your business to make those sales.</p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600"> A POS system allows your business to accept payments from customers and keep track of sales. It sounds simple enough, but the setup can work in different ways, depending on whether you sell online, have a physical storefront, or both.</p>
